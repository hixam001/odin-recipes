        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish, featuring layers of flat pasta, meat sauce (often with beef or sausage), 
            ricotta or cottage cheese, and mozzarella, all baked together until bubbly and golden. It's a flavorful and 
            satisfying casserole, often served as a main course.
